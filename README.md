# SPI DAC and Power Control

## Overview

This project contains scripts to control DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters) and power supplies via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) using the `pyftdi` and `pyvisa` libraries. The scripts demonstrate setting DAC ranges and voltages, as well as reading chip IDs and controlling power supplies.
